# Building a Calculator in Python: A Beginner's Guide

Hey there! It's awesome that you want to build a calculator in Python at 15 - that's a great project to start with. I'll walk you through what you need to know.

## Basic Python Concepts You'll Need

1. *Variables*: Store numbers and results
   python
   num1 = 5
   num2 = 3
   

2. *Input/Output*: Get user input and display results
   python
   user_input = input("Enter a number: ")
   print("The result is:", result)
   

3. *Data Types*: Working with numbers and strings
   - int() - convert to whole numbers
   - float() - convert to decimal numbers

4. *Basic Math Operations*:
   python
   +  # addition
   -  # subtraction
   *  # multiplication
   /  # division
   %  # modulus (remainder)
   

5. *Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)*: For choosing operations
   python
   if operation == "+":
       result = num1 + num2
   

## Simple Calculator Example

Here's a basic version to start with:

python
print("Simple Calculator")

# Get numbers from user
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Ask for operation
print("Choose operation:")
print("+ : Addition")
print("- : Subtraction")
print("* : Multiplication")
print("/ : Division")
operation = input("Enter operation: ")

# Perform calculation
if operation == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
elif operation == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
elif operation == "*":
    result = num1 * num2
elif operation == "/":
    result = num1 / num2
else:
    result = "Invalid operation!"

# Display result
print("Result:", result)


## Next Steps to Improve It

Once you have this working, you could:
1. Add more operations (exponents, square roots)
2. Make it loop so you can do multiple calculations
3. Add error handling (for division by zero)
4. Create a graphical interface (later with Tkinter)
