--- GUI Calculator Project Documentation ---

1. What is Python?
	- Python is a popular programming language that is easy to learn and great for beginners.

2. What is tkinter?
	- tkinter is a built-in Python library for making windows, buttons, and other GUI elements.
	- You do not need to install anything extra to use tkinter.

3. How does the calculator work?
	- The calculator opens a window with buttons for numbers and operations.
	- You click buttons to enter numbers and choose operations (+, -, *, /).
	- Press '=' to see the result, or 'C' to clear the entry box.

4. How to run the calculator?
	- Open your terminal (PowerShell).
	- Type: python main.py
	- The calculator window will appear.

5. What does each part of the code do?
	- import tkinter as tk: Loads the GUI library.
	- root = tk.Tk(): Creates the main window.
	- entry = tk.Entry(...): Adds a box to show numbers/results.
	- button_click(value): Adds the clicked number/operator to the entry box.
	- button_clear(): Clears the entry box.
	- button_equal(): Calculates the result and shows it.
	- Buttons: Each button is created and placed in the window grid.
	- root.mainloop(): Starts the GUI and keeps the window open.

6. How to improve the calculator?
	- You can change colors, fonts, or add more features (like more operations).
	- You can learn about other GUI libraries for more advanced designs.

7. Common problems and solutions:
	- If Python is not installed, download it from python.org and add it to PATH.
	- If the calculator window does not appear, check for errors in the terminal.

8. Next steps:
	- Try changing the code to customize your calculator.
	- Learn more about Python and tkinter online (YouTube, tutorials, docs).
